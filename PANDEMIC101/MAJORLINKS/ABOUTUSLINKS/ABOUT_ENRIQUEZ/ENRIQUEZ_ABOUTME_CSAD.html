	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI am from the 
	province of Pampanga.<sup>1</sup> I am an energetic, friendly,cheerful kid back then.
	<sup>2</sup> At school, I'm always in honor roll.<sup>3</sup> I am always an honor 
	student.<sup>4</sup> At home, I always like to play outside.<sup>5</sup> Getting dirty 
	and all that stuff.<sup>6</sup> I always like to play outdoor activities.<sup>7</sup> Back then 
	I had a crush.<sup>8</sup> She's my classmate, so I always get to see her.<sup>9</sup> I took her 
	to her serive vehicle always after school.<sup>10</sup> Maybe back then, that's my way of escorting 
	her.<sup>11</sup> At home, when I was a child, we're not using too much internet and 
	social media.<sup>12</sup>I didn't even know internet back then.<sup>13</sup> So, I had 
	no way of contacting her.<sup>14</sup> Time passed by, me and my family moved here in Manila
	around Taguig City.<sup>15</sup> I didn't even get to say goodbye to her.<sup>16</sup> 
	I was between 7 to 10 around that time.<sup>17</sup> Now that I think about it, 
	I get a little bit sad.<sup>18</sup> I always thought of the "<i>what if's</i>".<sup>19</sup> 
	There goes me.<sup>20</sup></p>

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow, I am becoming
	a teenager.<sup>1</sup> Starting to have puberty.<sup>2</sup> Getting taller and all that 
	stuff.<sup>3</sup> I had forgotten about my childhood crush.<sup>4</sup> Of course, 
	there's a new girl thatI liked when we moved here in Manila.<sup>5</sup> Now that I 
	think about it, there's alwaysa new girl I like every grade level.<sup>6</sup> Time passed
	by again and I graduated in elementary level.<sup>7</sup> Becoming high school back then 
	was scary.<sup>8</sup> New school, new friends, new classmates, new way in teaching 
	lessons.<sup>9</sup> Mostly all things were new and it was scary as a shy kid.<sup>10</sup> 
	First year in high school, I met this girl in my class.<sup>11</sup> Most of my classmates 
	were saying she had a bad attitude.<sup>12</sup> I didn't care because I liked her all through 
	the second year of high school when she flew away from Philippines.<sup>13</sup> Third year
	of high school, I had a new crush again.<sup>14</sup> She was so pretty that I cannot even
	say a single word when I was in front of her.<sup>15</sup> It got until my last year of junior 
	high school.<sup>16</sup> In my senior years, I had my first girlfriend.<sup>17</sup> But 
	I wasn't too serious.<sup>18</sup> I was more focused in playing basketball since the first
	 year of high school.<sup>19</sup> So we onlylasted for 8 months.<sup>20</sup></p>

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs I grow and become 
	an adult, I learned in my experience.<sup>1</sup> I experienced and still experiencing some
	things.<sup>2</sup> I graduated high school.<sup>3</sup> I am getting closer and closer to 
	reality.<sup>4</sup> I am less focused in my hobbies.<sup>5</sup> Especially in today's 
	problem, which is the pandemic.<sup>6</sup> You can't do so much unlike the past 
	years.<sup>7</sup> I currently have a girlfriend and I pray that this person will be 
	the last.<sup>8</sup> I experienced enough that I want to stay to this person until the 
	last of my breath.<sup>9</sup> I want to cherish and keep what I have today.<sup>10</sup> 
	Because it is hard to find someone who you can truly trust and be comfortable 
	with.<sup>11</sup> This is me.<sup>12</sup> <i><b>I am Marc Anselm P. Enriquez</b></i>.
	<sup>13</sup> You may wonder why am I telling you stories about me, especially 
	my love life.<sup>14</sup> Well, it's because"<i><strong>we love as we live, we 
	live as we love</strong></i>".<sup>15</sup> It's a wonderful feeling to love 
	someone.<sup>16</sup>Stop the fighting and arguments.<sup>17</sup> Live in peace.
	<sup>18</sup> It is what God wants, to live in peace and to protect one 
	another.<sup>19</sup> Live, love and linger.<sup>20</sup></p>

		<h1> ABOUT PARIS, FRANCE</h1>
		<h2>Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, 
		with an estimated population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018, 
		in an area of more than 105 square km. 
		Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major 
		centers of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science and arts. 
		The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the 
		Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2017 
		population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of 
		France.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<h1>GETTING TO PARIS, FRANCE</h1>
		<h2>You will probably arrive at either Charles De Gaulle 
		or Orly Airport, both of which are about 45 minutes from 
		the center of Paris unless there is traffic. If nobody is 
		meeting you the easiest way to get into the city is by taxi
		which will cost a little under 25 euros from Orly and around
		50 euros from De Gaulle.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Provence</h3>
				<h4>Provence basks under the Mediterranean sun. 
				This alluring countryside has a rugged and earthy appeal. 
				The rolling hills are covered with a patchwork of small farms,
				olive groves, sunflowers, and lavender fields. The air is 
				fragrant with the aroma of rosemary, sage, and thyme, herbs
				that grow in abundance and are used in the local cuisine. 
				In this dreamy landscape, Impressionist painters found 
				inspiration to create vibrant works of art.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<img src="Images/Côte_d'Azur_France.jpg">
		<h3>The Côte d'Azur</h3><br>
				<h4>The Côte d'Azur (French Riviera) is a glamorous 
				stretch of Mediterranean coastline named for its deep 
				azure-blue waters. The skies are often a mesmerizing 
				cerulean hue as well, thanks to the sunny weather most 
				of the year in this area of southern France.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				
		<img src="Images/CirqueMountains_France.jpg">
		<h3>Cirque de Gavarnie in the Pyrenees Mountains</h3><br>
				<h4>The mountainous Pyrenees region is a soul-inspiring 
				place that offers both natural splendor and spiritual 
				wonders (including many sacred pilgrimage sites). 
				The UNESCO-listed Cirque de Gavarnie is nature's version 
				of a cathedral. Forming a semicircle, the awesome 
				1,700-meter-high limestone rock walls are draped with 
				dramatic waterfalls that tumble down into rushing rivers 
				and peaceful streams.</h4><br><br><br>

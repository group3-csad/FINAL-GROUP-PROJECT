		<h1> ABOUT ROME, ITALY</h1>
		<h2>Rome, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province),
		of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy. Rome is
		located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the
		Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.
		Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and
		polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly
		indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of
		the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of
		artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City,
		remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a
		memorial to the creative imagination of the 
		past.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<h1>GETTING TO ROME, ITALY</h1>
		<h2>If you are flying to Rome, you should know there are two airports
		in Rome: Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) and Ciampino. Fiumicino 
		airport is the main Rome international airport. Ciampino used to 
		be a military airport, and in recent years it has become a hub for 
		many of the low-cost airlines that fly to Rome.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Venice</h3>
				<h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWho could fail to love a city whose streets are made 
				of water, whose buses are boats, and where the songs of 
				gondoliers linger in the air? It is a magic city, and its 
				major attraction to tourists is the city itself. The hub 
				of the city is the broad Piazza San Marco, St. Mark's Square,
				surrounded by several of its top tourist attractions. 
				The great Basilica of St. Mark stands beside the Doge's
				Palace, and overlooking both is the tall Campanile.<br><br>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGondolas congregate at the end of the plaza in the Grand
				Canal, and in the other direction, a gate under the clock
				tower leads into a warren of narrow, winding passageways, 
				where you're sure to get lost on the way to Rialto Bridge.
				But getting lost is one of the greatest pleasures of Venice,
				where a postcard scene awaits around each corner.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Naples</h3>
				<h4>As the canals characterize Venice, and the Renaissance
				is the essence of Florence, in Naples, it's the sheer 
				exuberance that will hold you spellbound. It's a boisterous
				place, its narrow streets filled with color, noise, and life.
				You'll find plenty to see and do and experience here, 
				in its treasure-filled churches, its magnificent palaces
				lavished in the riches of European royalty, and its premier
				archaeological museum displaying the finds from nearby 
				Pompeii.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				
		<img src="Images/turin_ITALY.jpg">
		<h3>Turin</h3>
				<h4>One of the great industrial cities of the north,
				Turin, unlike Milan, is relatively small and compact,
				its highlights easy to explore on foot. There is a
				grandeur to its architecture and its formal layout,
				designed by the Savoys to show that they were as regal
				as any of Europe's royal families and could surround
				themselves with splendor that rivaled Paris.</h4><br><br><br>

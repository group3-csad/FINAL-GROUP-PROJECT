		<h1> ABOUT SANTORINI, GREECE</h1>
		<h2>A visit to Santorini is the ultimate gastronomic experience,
		as the island is a true culinary paradise! Treat your taste buds
		to some famous traditional products like cherry tomatoes, white
		egg plants, fava, caper and “hloró tyrí”, a special kind of fresh
		goat cheese found on the island, or why not try some of the
		exceptional wines produced from grapes grown in the volcanic soil
		of the island! Assyrtiko, Athyri, Aidani, Mantilaria and Mavrotragano
		are just some of the distinctive varieties that you can taste at
		the island’s famous wineries (some of them operate as a museum as
		well) or at restaurants.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<h1>GETTING TO SANTORINI, GREECE</h1>
		<h2>You can travel either by plane (Athens International 
		Airport "Eleftherios Venizelos") or by ferryboat (Piraeus Port).
		There are also links between Santorini and other Greek islands.
		The flight is the quickest, easiest and most direct way as it
		lasts more or less 40 minutes and you can book your tickets in
		advance.<h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Peloponnese</h3>
				<h4>Shaped much like a large leaf, Peloponnese was
				traditionally called Morea, which means mulberry leaf.
				Located in the southernmost region of both Europe and
				Greece, Peloponnese is a wide peninsula connected to the
				mainland by the Rio-Antirrio bridge.<br><br>

				Interspersed with classical Greek temples, Venetian
				fortresses, Byzantine churches and Mycenaean palaces,
				Peloponnese echoes the ancient cultures and events from
				its extensive history. Among these ancient ruins is Olympia,
				where the first Olympic Games were hosted in honor of
				Zeus.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<img src="Images/crete_greece.jpg">
		<h3>Crete</h3>
				<h4>The largest of the Greek islands, Crete is a
				spacious land of pleasing contrasts where landscapes
				range from stunning coastline to rugged mountains and
				rolling countryside dotted with olive trees.<br><br>

				Bustling metropolitan cities spread beyond to quiet
				villages centered around outdoor coffee shops. Steeped
				in history, Crete still bears archaeological traces of
				the many civilizations that inhabited it down through the
				centuries.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				
		<img src="Images/athens_greece.jpg">
		<h3>Athens</h3>
				<h4>Inhabited for more than 3,000 years, Athens is
				widely known as the cradle of Western civilization
				and the birthplace of democracy. The city presents
				a confusing blend of historical and modern features.
				Athens is famous for its archaeological ruins and monuments
				such as the famous Acropolis, the Parthenon, the Ancient
				Agora and the Theatre of Dionysos just to name a few.<br><br>

				However, Athens is not just about ancient ruins. This
				bustling city is also an important center for business,
				culture and nightlife.</h4><br><br><br>

		<h1> ABOUT ANTARCTICA</h1>
		<h2>Antarctica is the coldest, windiest and driest continent.
		It contains 90 percent of all of the ice on Earth in an area 
		just under 1.5 times the size of the United States. But the 
		southernmost continent is much more than a big block of ice. 
		Lying in the Antarctic Circle that rings the southern part of 
		the globe, Antarctica is the fifth largest continent. Its size 
		varies through the seasons, as expanding sea ice along the coast
		nearly doubles the continent's size in the winter. Almost all 
		of Antarctica is covered with ice; less than half a percent of
		the vast wilderness is ice-free.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<h1>GETTING TO ANTARCTICA</h1>
		<h2>You can get to Antarctica by boat or plane. Sailing the
		Drake Passage from the tip of South America to the Antarctic
		Peninsula takes 48 hours. Flying to Antarctica takes 2 hours.
		Approximately 54,000 visitors make the journey each year, with
		around 50 expedition vessels sailing Antarctic waters each 
		season.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

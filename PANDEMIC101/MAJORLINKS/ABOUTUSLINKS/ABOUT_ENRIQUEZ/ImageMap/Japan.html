		<h1> ABOUT KYOTO, JAPAN</h1>
		<h2>Kyoto is Japan in a nutshell. It’s the cultural and
		historical heart of the country. It’s the best place in all
		Japan to experience traditional temples, shrines, gardens,
		geisha, shops, restaurants and festivals. In short, Kyoto is
		the most rewarding destination in all of Japan and it should
		be at the top of any Japan travel itinerary. Indeed, I may be
		biased, but I’d go so far as to say that Kyoto is the most
		rewarding single city in all of Asia.</h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<h1>GETTING TO KYOTO, JAPAN</h1>
		<h2>A lot of airlines fly from Manila to Kansai Airport.
		If you book way in advance, you'll get the best deals from
		Cebu Pacific Air. Cebu Pacific flies to Osaka five times a week.
		Their lowest year-round fare is at P6399, which is a great deal
		already.<h2><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		
		<h1>OTHER PLACES TO VISIT</h1>

		<h3>Mount Fuji</h3>
				<h4>Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark,
				majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) is also the country's
				highest mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an
				otherwise largely flat landscape to the south and east,
				this majestic and fabled mountain is tall enough to be
				seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.<br><br>

				Mount Fuji has for centuries been celebrated in art and
				literature and is now considered so important an icon that
				UNESCO recognized its world cultural significance in 2013.
				Part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Mount Fuji is
				climbed by more than a million people each summer as an act
				of pilgrimage, which culminates in watching the sunrise
				from its summit.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Osaka Castle</h3>
				<h4>Built in 1586 by famous Japanese warrior and
				politician Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Osaka Castle (Ōsaka-jō) was
				at the time the largest and most important fortress in the
				country. Although destroyed and rebuilt a number of times
				since, the present structure, built in 1931, remains true
				to the original.<Br><br>

				Highlights of a visit include the huge five-story,
				42-meter-tall main tower. Built on an imposing 14-meter-tall
				stone base, the tower is home to a number of displays
				detailing the history of the castle and the city. Be sure
				to visit the top floor for its superb views over Osaka,
				an especially attractive sight as the sun sets.<br><br>

				Also of interest in Osaka Castle Park is the Hokoku Shrine,
				while Osaka's best-known temple, Shitennō-ji, is also worth
				visiting and dates back to AD 59. Notable as Japan's first
				Buddhist temple, this lovely shrine features a five-story
				pagoda along with a number of other exquisitely decorated
				buildings. Among them are the Golden Pavilion (Kondō),
				with its fine statues and paintings; the Lecture Hall
				(Kōdō); and a lovely covered corridor linking three of
				the site's gates.</h4><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h3>Chūbu-Sangaku National Park and the Japanese Alps</h3>
				<h4>Japan boasts a number of outstanding areas of natural
				beauty, many of them designated as national parks or, in
				some cases, UNESCO World Heritage Sites. One of the
				country's most spectacular of these is Chūbu-Sangaku
				National Park in the center of Honshu. Located in the
				park's northern and central regions is the group of
				mountains collectively referred to as the Hida Mountains,
				or Japanese Alps.</h4><br><br><br>

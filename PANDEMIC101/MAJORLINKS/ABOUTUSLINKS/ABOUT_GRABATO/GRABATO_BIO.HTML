    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/child.jpg" align="left" width="250"><p>
    			 Hi! <sup>1</sup>I am Jane Ashley, my friends and family call me "Jaz" or "Ash/Ashley".
    			<sup>2</sup>Born on the 7th day of the last month of the 2nd millennium. 
				<sup>3</sup>I'm the eldest of two siblings, and also the eldest grandchild for both my mom and dad's side. 
				<sup>4</sup>As a kid, I was very lucky to grow up surrounded by mostly family.<sup>5</sup>Both of my parents were 
				working most of my childhood, and aside from a helper there will always be at least one relative there with us, may 
				it be one of my aunts or uncles, or either of my grandparents.</p></blockquote>

    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/childdd.jpg" align="right" width="250"><p>
    			Have you watched the Pixar movie <i>"Inside Out"</i>? <sup>1</sup> In the movie,
				they have this thing that they call the "<b>Core Memories</b>"; and those memories are the memories that were 
				built and remembers by the child.<sup>2</sup> For me, my core memories are mostly watching cartoons, singing along 
				to Disney Movies when that iconic song comes, playing barbie, <i>luto-lutuan, bamsak, patintero, langit-lupa</i>, 
				being annoyed by my brother, and going to the mall every weekend. <sup>3</sup>Another core memory I have is the week 
				of my grandfather's death. <sup>4</sup>I was just 6 years old, barely knows anything about life. <sup>5</sup>I think I 
				remember those times specifically because of the number of visitors we had every night. <sup>6</sup>I'm thankful that 
				I've experienced being a kid in the streets. <sup>7</sup>Playing 'til the sun disappears and having that <i>"dungis"</i>
				phase. <sup>8</sup>We used to have a garden in the back of our house, my dad had put up a hammock between the santol trees 
				and I would just hang there every afternoon. <sup>9</sup>As a kid, I've also experience selling santol, home-made chocolates,
				and home-made candles in front of our house.<img src="PHOTOS/childd.jpg" align="left" height="300"> <sup>10</sup> My childhood friends, mostly consist of my cousins and neighbors, 
				really made those times memorable. <sup>11</sup>We had a few years of falling out, probably because of going through different 
				stages, but now, I'm glad that we're slowly rebuilding the friendship we had before.</p></blockquote>

    		<blockquote><p>
    			As for my early education, I entered Kindergarten when I was 5 years old. <sup>1</sup>I studied in 
				<b>Sta. Rosa Catholic School</b> here in Pasig. <sup>2</sup>I've spent most of my early life in that school, the best and the 
				worst <i>(so far)</i>. It's nice to look back at those times and appreciate the people I've met in pre-school, who I've never
				thought would still be my friends now.<sup>3</sup> I wasn't an achiever in pre-school nor elementary, I was just enjoying and
				doing what I need to do. <sup>4</sup>My favorite parts of every school year are the programs-where we would compete with the 
				other sections and grade levels. <sup>5</sup>Our batch was VERY competitive, and there will be times that the "competition" is 
				not healthy anymore.<sup>6</sup >But hey, whenever we look back to those days and realize how bad of a mentality we had, we can't 
				help but laugh because it brought so many good and bad memories. </p></blockquote>
    	
    	<h2 id = "teen">Teenage Years</h2>
    	
    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/teen.jpg" align="right" width="230"><p>
    			Like any other teenager, I thought that those years were going to be <b>"Those Years"</b>. 
				<sup>1</sup>With all those coming-of-age films and shows that I saw as a kid, like <i>High School Musical, Camp Rock, Sky High, 
				Victorious</i>, etc; I thought What would I achieve in high school or my teenage years will determine my future. <sup>2</sup>Well 
				that wasn't the case. <sup>3</sup>It was as dramatic, <strong>definitely, YES!!</strong> the storyline of having competitions, 
				friendship falling-outs, cheesy graduations, and intense confrontations <i>(that still makes me cringe to this day)</i> made it 
				memorable.</p></blockquote>

    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/srcs.jpg" align="left" height="200"><p>
    			When I entered high school, there I saw that I can do better as a student. <sup>1</sup>I wasn't the smart 
				kid, it's my brother. <sup>2</sup>And at a young age I've accepted that. <sup>3</sup> A big thank you to my parents that they didn't 
				compare us siblings; so I didn't need to feel like it was a competition, rather I heard it from other people. <sup>4</sup>In grade 7,
				where I realized that I can also be an Outstanding student. <sup>5</sup>I was a different person in high school. <sup>6</sup> With 
				the help of my batchmates, I've found confidence. <sup>7</sup>Probably because I was surrounded by the same people for 8-13 years. 
				<sup>8</sup>I joined the coordinating body, I was the secretary in 2015. <sup>9</sup>Communication Arts were my favorite subject, both
				English and Filipino, so I also joined the School Paper. <sup>10</sup>I was fond of photography, that was one of my tasks in the 
				school paper, that is also why I always look forward when there's an upcoming event. <sup>11</sup>I can bring my camera <i>(with 
				permission from admin ofc)</i> and just take shots of people on the campus having fun.

    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/ama2.jpg" align="right" width="270"><p>
    			Senior High school was a big transition for me. <sup>1</sup>I had to move to a new school because my previous 
				school doesn't offer SHS. <sup>2</sup>Choosing a track was a hard decision for me because I never had a <i>"Dream Profession"</i>.
				<sup>2</sup>Growing up, I envy my friends who have a dream career, a doctor, architect, businessman... but me, I never really saw
				myself in a particular field of work. <sup>3</sup>I studied TVL-Programming at <b>AMA Computer College</b> in Pasig. <sup>4</sup>I
				honestly chose that track because of how in-demand computer course graduates are. <sup>5</sup>Slowly I got to appreciate my track 
				when it could be frustrating sometimes but I'm getting the hang of it. <sup>6</sup>During my stay in AMA is also where I got to 
				appreciate small things in life. <sup>7</sup>Its a private school but they also have programs for public school graduates, In our 
				class, we were composed of different types of students from different walks of life. <sup>8</sup>I've learned to appreciate more the 
				things I have.<sup>9</sup>At last the environment was new to me, new faces, new building, new teachers it was like having a fresh start. 
				<sup>10</sup>Finally, I was out of my comfort environment.

		<h2 id = "college">College Years</h2>
    		
    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/ue1.jpg" align="right" height="250"><p> 
    			College was a big step. <sup>1</sup>I knew that I want to experience studying outside the city. <sup>2</sup>I tried 
				to look for schools that will not only have my course but also a school that we can afford and get quality education from. 
				<sup>3</sup>Ever since elementary the UAAP schools are already familiar to me. <sup>4</sup>I used to watch UAAP games on 
				TV with my cousin, and thinking if I would be able to study in one of those schools. <sup>5</sup>Before finally landing at 
				<b> the University of the East</b>, I also took the <strong>UPCAT</strong> and other college entrance exams. <sup>6</sup>
				Even though I did not get in the UP branches I chose, the whole entrance exam was already <i>an experience</i> itself. 
				<sup>7</sup>Processing the papers, commuting to Quezon City without any knowledge was tough but	I'm glad I've experienced that. 
				<sup>8</sup>I also got to experience the whole process with my friends and my mom -<i>who was very supportive 
				and waited for me to from registration to the actual examination.</i>    			
    		</p></blockquote>
    		<blockquote><img src="PHOTOS/college.jpg" align="left" width="200"><p>
    			I decided to go to UE not only because it's a UAAP member but also because of its influence. <sup>1</sup>One of my aunts 
				was an alumnus of UE under the College of Business Administration. <sup>2</sup>I also have friends who studied SHS in UE and will
				continue their college there. <sup>3</sup>It was somewhat comforting to know that I have friends in the university even we're not 
				from the same colleges. <sup>4</sup>Like any other new student I was nervous in the first weeks. <sup>5</sup>It was my first time
				commuting outside of the city alone, experience Manila traffic and, being in a big school. <sup>6</sup>I am an introvert with an 
				RBF <i>(resting b*t*h face)</i> so I had a difficult time socializing. <sup>7</sup>My blockmates were approachable, although I did 
				not have a good first impression on most, especially the girls. <sup>8</sup>It's weird to think that the people with who I didn't
				have a good first impression are the people who I'm very close to today. <sup>9</sup>Its funny when we look back on our first
				encounters and remembering the feeling of <i><b>"oh, I'm not going to get along with this person"</b></i> to <i><b>"I don't know
				how I could survive each sem without these people"</b></i>. <sup>10</sup>The best part of my freshman year was the out-campus hangouts,
				that's what I miss during this whole quarantine. <sup>11</sup>Our after school food trips, venting out our frustrations in acads,
				having <i>chismis</i>, and just being in the presence of friends. <img src="PHOTOS/ue2.jpg" align="right" height="250"><p><sup>12</sup> Most of our hang-outs revolve around school-works 
				and food. <sup>13</sup>Before the quarantine, we had a goal of eating in all Unli-wings restaurants around the university belt 
				area. <sup>14</sup> We're already in almost half of our college years. <sup>15</sup>Yet our first day still feels like it was just
				a few weeks back. <sup>16</sup>Time is indeed fast, it's more noticeable now that we're just in our homes.     			
    		</p></blockquote>
    		<blockquote>
    			During freshman year, is also where I decided to just let myself <b>go with the flow</b>. <sup>1</sup>I don't want to put any
				pressure on myslef. <sup>2</sup>If things go well, then great. <sup>3</sup>But if things don't go the way I want to, then <b>
				accept, move on and be better</b>. <sup>4</sup>This is where I realized that the only competition I have is me. <sup>5</sup>Not
				putting pressure on myself is <i>(so far)</i> a great decision I've made. <sup>6</sup>I've allowed myself not to meet my standards 
				and make mistakes. <sup>7</sup>Sometimes I miss having recognitions, but <b><i>the only recognition I need is from myself and
				that's more important</i></b>.
